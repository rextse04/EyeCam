# Eye-to-Face Generation (CCTV Implementation)
This software can be used to generate a face from an eye by first capturing a person’s eye, then inputting it into our model and generate a whole face. The reason for us to produce a product and a model of such is because in normal circumstances, security or surveillance cameras aren’t able to capture both eyes of the suspect at a horisontal angle. Therefore, a model that only takes a one-eye input will have a massive advantage in practical appliance. To use our product, firstly, click your cursor on the person’s eye in the security camera window. After a few seconds of waiting, a face that correlates to the eye will then be generated. To obtain best results, it is suggested that our camera to be put at a relatively higher angle, as well as keeping a good source of lighting within the environment.
